			<h2> Backstory of the product</h2>
			<p> Before competitive sparing was done with electronic fighting gear. The fighting was done with the standard fighting gear without any sensor in it. 
				Here you needed multiple good, trained referees to keep track of the points and the no go’s (kicks under the belt and punches on the face). 
				Electronic fighting systems are also cool because you use theology in competitive sports and that’s what I find cool and special because you use technology in sport. </p>

	<article id="problem">
		<h2> What problem does this solve</h2>
		<p> This solves the need for multiple referees watching who scored and counting it himself because that’s wat the system does for the referees, 
			this makes the counting somewhat fairer and more linear. And now you will know if a kick connected correctly on the body. 
			Another big plus is that if you livestream the fight, 
			you can put the points data on screen for people at home to see the score. </p>
	</article>
	
	<article id="how">
		<h2>How to use.</h2>
		<p>It’s simple you need body protector, foot protector, hand protector and head gear to get started and you need special software to read the data. 
			And the rest is simple you connect everything wirelessly and you are ready to fight. 
			This is not something you buy for yourself but if you buy it for your club to use and train with it’s a good option for training purposes. And there are enough videos on the internet</p>

	<article id="who">
		<h2>Who is using this innovation.</h2>
		<p> This innovation is mainly used in Olympic taekwondo. But that’s not the only place for the use of this technology the place where I train has one set to, 
			for training purposes. Why would a club buy this innovation for training: 
			that’s because it’s not the same as your own gear without electronics so you can train with it and feel the difference and it’s fun to try it out for once.  </p>

	<article id ="service">
		<h2> What can you expect from the service this company is delivering. </h2>
		<p> You can expect them to deliver a quality product and if something is wrong you can mail them and expect a mail back with help. And if you need additional help, 
			they maybe can help you form the phone. And there are always manuals you can use when setting up. And if you have a broken product because it was shipped wrong, 
			they will send a replacement and hopefully an apology mail. </p>
	</article>
	
	<article id="future">
		<h2> Future from this innovation. </h2>
		<p> I hope this innovation will grow more and get even better so the system is the more reliable than the last version. 
			And it hopefully will not make any mistakes a human will make so we all can trust the points given to the accurately and that there will not be any miscalculation and if there is one that they can fix it very quickly. 
			The future will tell us what will happen with this innovation. </p>
