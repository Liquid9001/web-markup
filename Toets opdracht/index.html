			<h2> Electronic Fighting Systems </h2>
			<p> Electronic Fighting Systems are handy for competitive sports because the human eye cannot always see what is happening when the kicks and punches are exchanged very quickly. 
				So electronic fighting systems can help you keep track about how much points need to be given and the power of your kicks and punches. 
				How this works you have sensors in your body protector, head protector and you have some on your feet. 
				These work together to track points and power of your kicks.</p>

			<h2> Better Lights </h2>
			<p>We need light to see in the dark but that can cost a lot of money to light a field for hours. It would be better to use lights that are not power hungry and make more heat than light. 
			   Well, it’s good we have LED (Light Emitting Diode) today. LED are more efficient and can give more light for a lower electric bill. 
			   So, my main point is that these lights are efficient for your sport club it will cost them less money to light the fields.

			<h2> Smartwatches </h2>
			<p>Smartwatches are perfect for people who sport and who do not. 
				Because it can track everything for steps you have taken to your blood pressure, this is nice because you can track how much calories you have burned while training, running, or swimming.
				To own a smartwatch you don’t even need to be a sports person because you can also use it to track calorie burning from the whole day of work, and some smartwatches have extra safety features like apples, 
				apple watch those are equipped with crash detection for when you fall or crash your car.</p>
